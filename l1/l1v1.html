    <h1>Spring and Fall</h1>
    <h4>By Gerard Manley Hopkins</h4>
    <br>
    <p>Margaret, are you grieving
      <br>
       Over Goldengrove unleaving?
      <br>
      <br>
       Leaves, like the things of man, you
      <br>
       With your fresh thoughts care for, can you?
      <br>
      <br>
       Ah! as the heart grows older
      <br>
       It will come to such sights colder
      <br>
      <br>
       By & by, nor spare a sigh
      <br>
       Though worlds of wanwood leafmeal lie;
      <br>
      <br>
       And yet you wíll weep & know why.
      <br>
       Now no matter, child, the name:
      <br>
      <br>
       Sorrow's springs are the same.
      <br>
       Nor mouth had, no nor mind, expressed
      <br>
      <br>
       What héart héard of, ghóst guéssed:
      <br>
       It is the blight man was born for,
      <br>
      <br>
       It is Margaret you mourn for.
